## Overview
Project: Pet Clinic Manager

### Summary of Contributions

New Feature:
- Added the ability to add/remove Tasks, and reassign Task from one employee to another
What it does: 
- After a Task is added into the overall TaskList, it is also added to the associated Appointment and Employee (to do the Task).
- Reassigning a Task will move the Task from one employee's Task List to another employee's Task List.
Justification: 
- This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
Highlights: 
- This enhancement was one of the most complex portions of this application as it required intricate interactions with almost every other feature (Appointment, Employee, Service, Pet)
Credits: {mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}
New Feature: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
